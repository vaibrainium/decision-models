# Decision-Models

Simulation and fitting decision models to behavior data. Drastically fast simulation time with the help of CUDA programming. 

1) Drift-Diffusion Model
2) Independent Accumulator Model:
		A truly unified model with DDM like as well as race like features. Also have features to simulate Leaky Competing-Accumulator (LCA).
